# My-simple-Face-Recognition-project
This is my school FaceRecognition project and instruction to how to use.
There is 2 source code file with 2 different function:
  - The first one is Foundation.py. This python file is to exlpain how the FaceRecognition api works, all you need is to put 2 picture of a person into Picture and Test folder then run the code, it will tell if the person in 2 photos is the same or 2 distinct person.0
  - The second one is the project itself. This is the marking or attendance project so to call. Just simply put 1 photo of the person you want to mark in Picture folder and put their name as that photos name. Then run the code, it will open up your webcam and detect any face show on webcam, if the face which shows on webcam is the same as one in Picture folder the code will detect and write their name on screen and in Marking.csv file (if not it will show unknown).
